<h1>4 personal loan lenders that accept applicants with credit scores that are 580 or lower</h1>
<div>
<p>There are manyadvantages to having good or excellent credit. For one, a high credit score can help youget approvedfor financial products &mdash; likepersonal loans&mdash; with a lower interest rate. Still, there are some personal loans out there that keep customer flexibility in mind. In other words, even if your credit score is less than ideal, you still have a solid chance of getting approved for the loan you need.</p>
<p>Some lenders cater to applicants with lowercredit scores in the poor range(below 580) to help them borrow money for emergency expenses, a medical bill,debt consolidationand other financing needs.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Below,CNBC Selectrounded up four of thebest personal loan lendersthat still accept applicants who havecredit scores of 580 or lower. We looked at fees, interest rates and flexible repayment options for different credit scores. (You can read more aboutourmethodologybelow.)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you&rsquo;re applying for loans &mdash; or any line of credit &mdash; with a lower credit score, you are likely to receive higher interest rates because lenders will see you as more of a &ldquo;riskier&rdquo; borrower. It&rsquo;s important to compare rates with different lenders and do your homework before signing to make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with your new loan terms. If you want toincrease your credit scoreto get a better interest rate or loan terms, there are a few ways to do so, some of them which can haveimmediate effects.</p>

<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s this for?</strong>According toUpstart&rsquo;s website, applicants with a credit history should apply with aminimum credit score of 300(though, Upstart also accepts applicants with no credit history). Sometimes, a potential borrower may have alow credit scorebecause they have extremely limited credit activity. Other times, a lack of credit history may result in them having no credit score at all. Just keep in mind that if you&rsquo;re approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate.</p>
<div></div>
<p>You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. And while there areno penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater).</p>
<p>When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.</p>

<p><strong>Information about OneMain Financial&rsquo;s secured loans:</strong></p>
<p>While not required, applicants who don&rsquo;t qualify for an unsecured personal loan with OneMain Financial may be offered a secured loan. A secured loan lets borrowers who want to use the equity from their car potentially qualify for lower interest that way. Rates, repayment terms and agreements vary by individual and the state in which apply. Learn more by checking for offers on OneMain Financial&rsquo;s site.</p>
<p><em>OneMain Financial link provided by Even Financial.</em></p>
<p><em>Not all applicants will be approved. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on your ability to meet our credit standards (including a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and availability of collateral) and your state of residence. If approved, not all applicants will qualify for larger loan amounts or most favorable loan terms. Larger loan amounts require a first lien on a motor vehicle no more than ten years old, that meets our value requirements, titled in your name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Highly-qualified applicants may be offered higher loan amounts and/or lower APRs than those shown above. OneMain charges origination fees where allowed by law. Depending on the state where you open your loan, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of your loan amount. Flat fee amounts vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state ranging from 1% to 10% of your loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. Visit</em><em>omf.com/loanfees</em><em>for more information. Loan proceeds cannot be used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined by the CFPB&rsquo;s Regulation Z such as college, university or vocational expense; for any business or commercial purpose; to purchase cryptocurrency assets, securities, derivatives or other speculative investments; or for gambling or illegal purposes.</em><br/><br/>Borrowers in these states are subject to these minimum loan sizes<em>:<strong>Alabama:</strong>$2,100.<strong>California:</strong>$3,000.<strong>Georgia:</strong>$3,100.<strong>North Dakota:</strong>$2,000.<strong>Ohio:</strong>$2,000.<strong>Virginia:</strong>$2,600.</em><br/><br/><em><strong>Borrowers in these states are subject to these maximum loan sizes</strong>:<strong>North Carolina:</strong>$9,000 for unsecured loans to all customers, $9,000 for secured loans to present customers.<strong>Maine</strong>: $7,000.<strong>Mississippi:</strong>$12,000.<strong>West Virginia</strong>: $14,000. Loans to purchase a motor vehicle or powersports equipment from select Maine, Mississippi, and North Carolina dealerships are not subject to these maximum loan sizes.</em><br/><br/><em><strong>Example Loan:</strong>A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07.</em><br/><br/><em><strong>Time to Fund Loans:</strong>Funding within one hour after closing through SpeedFunds must be disbursed to a bank-issued debit card.

<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s this for?</strong>OneMain Financialgenerally accepts applicants with at least apoor or fair credit score(the exact credit score minimum is not disclosed but for reference, a poor credit score is considered to be between 300 and 579 and a fair credit score is considered to be between 580 and 669).</p>
<p>This lender offers terms that are more flexible than that of other lenders. For one, many lenders don&rsquo;t allow you to apply with a co-applicant, which can be a bit of a concern if you&rsquo;re worried your credit score will hurt your chances of securing a better interest rate. But with OneMain Financial, you should be able tosubmit your application with a co-applicant.</p>
<p>Another feature that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But withsecured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can choose the date their monthly payments are due.</p>
<p>The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren&rsquo;t any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).</p>

<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s this for?</strong>Avant&rsquo;s minimum credit score requirement for applicants is 550. And this lender can typically provide funding as early as the next business day after you&rsquo;ve been approved. This makes it appealing for those who may need money in a pinch &mdash; just make sure you submit all the necessary documents and information you provide is complete and accurate so you can get funded without a hitch.</p>
<p>This lender also offers personal loan amounts as low as $2,000 and as high as $35,000.</p>
<p>While there are no penalties for early payoff, there is an origination fee of up to 4.75% and a late fee of up to $25 after the 10-day grace period.</p>
</div>
<h2><a></a>Can I pre-qualify without hurting my credit score?</h2>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>It is possible to pre-qualify for a personal loan without hurting your credit score. Do some research before you apply. Read reviews and learnwhat to consider before agreeing to take on a loan. When you&rsquo;re ready to apply, follow these steps to make sure you don&rsquo;t ding your score too much.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shop around for the best rate</strong>. Avoidhard inquiriesby knowing your credit score before you submit a formal application so you know what you might qualify for. Many lenders will allow you to submit a prequalification form. Or consider using a lending platform (such asUpstartorLendingTree) to view multiple offers at once.</li>
<li><strong>Decide on the best offer.</strong>Choose the loan with the best monthly payment and interest rate for your budget. Be sure to look at how much the loan will cost you over the full length of the term and decide if the cost is worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Submit a formal application.</strong>Have your social security number on hand, as well as supporting documents such as bank statements and paystubs.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for final approval</strong>. This could take just a few minutes, an hour or up to 10 days. To facilitate speedier approval, apply during normal business hours and submit the required documents right away.</li>
<li><strong>Get your funds.</strong>Once your loan is approved, you&rsquo;ll be asked to input your bank account information so the funds are deposited into your account. You may also be able to request a paper check from your lender, or in the case of a consolidation loan, you may be able to have funds sent right to your creditors.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><a></a>Bottom line</h2>
<div>
<p>You can still get approved for a personal loan with a less-than-stellar credit score. Having a personal loan can help boost your credit score by strengthening your credit mix, but you must remember to make your payments on time each month. Late and missed payments show up as negative marks on your credit report.</p>

<h2><a></a>Why trust CNBC Select?</h2>
<div>
<p>At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every personal loan review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of loan products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. Seeour methodologyfor more information on how we choose the best personal loans.</p>
</div>
<h2><a></a>Our methodology</h2>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>To determine which personal loans are the best for consumers with a credit score of 580 or lower,CNBC Selectanalyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible, we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees.</p>
<p>When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed-rate APR:</strong>Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan&rsquo;s term, which means your monthly payment won&rsquo;t vary, making your budget easier to plan.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible minimum and maximum loan amounts/terms:</strong>Each lender provides more than one financing option that you can customize based on your monthly budget and how long you need to pay back your loan.</li>
<li><strong>No early payoff penalties:</strong>The lenders on our list do not charge borrowers for paying off loans early.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined application process:</strong>We considered whether lenders offered same-day approval decisions and a fast online application process.</li>
<li><strong>Customer support:</strong>Every loan on our list provides customer service available via telephone, email or secure online messaging. We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances.</li>
<li><strong>Fund disbursement:</strong>The loans on our list deliver funds promptly through either electronic wire transfer to your checking account or in the form of a paper check. Some lenders (which we noted) offer the ability to pay your creditors directly.</li>
<li><strong>Autopay discounts:</strong>We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%.</li>
<li><strong>Creditor payment limits and loan sizes:</strong>The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more</p>
