<p><strong><a></a>What is an Auto Loan? What are its different types?</strong></p>
<p>An Auto Loan is taken by borrowers to purchase a new or used private or commercial vehicle. Auto loans are secured loans where the vehicle itself is used as a collateral. It is offered by lenders for new cars, used cars, two wheelers (generally called a Two-wheeler Loan) and commercial vehicles (generally called a Commercial Vehicle Loan).</p>

<p><strong><a></a>What does the borrowing/repayment look like?</strong></p>
<p>Banks usually offer auto loan up to 90% of the cost for new vehicles and 85% for second hand vehicle. The vehicle is hypothecated to the lender, as collateral. The repayment is based on your monthly income and your ability to repay and the tenure is typically between 12-84 months.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a></a>What are the typical interest rates?</strong></p>
<p>Lenders fix interest rates depending on the type of vehicle and loan amount. Interest rates are usually fixed for auto loans.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a></a>What do lenders look for before granting an auto loan?</strong></p>
<p>Loan approval process for an auto loan is relatively easier when compared to home loan. However, a few basic criteria that lenders look for before approving your loan application are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CIBIL Score and Report:</strong>Like all other loans, lenders look at your current credit health as well as the pattern of your past payment history. Lenders look for a high CIBIL Score and good credit profile before determining the final status of your loan application. A higher CIBIL Score increases the probability of your loan approval.Click hereto check your CIBIL Score and Report for free now!!</li>
<li><strong>Employment and Income Status:</strong>Lenders also check that you have a stable employment and a steady source of monthly income, to ensure loan repayment over the entire duration of the loan.</li>
<li><strong>Current Loan Repayments:</strong>Lenders also keep a tab on all your existing EMIs, before making their decision to grant you the loan. They generally determine your EMI outflow and monthly income ratio. Make sure that your EMI obligations are not a very high percentage of your income.</li>

<p></p>
<p><strong><a></a>Which are the documents required for applying for an auto loan?</strong></p>
<p>The actual documentation required varies from one lender to the other. However the basic list of documents required by lenders are: Identity Proof, Address Proof, Salary and Bank Statement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a></a>What other costs, fees or charges do I have to incur?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the actual vehicle cost, you need to check out associated costs like taxes, registration fees, insurance amount, processing fee, documentation charges and stamp duty etc. It is always advisable to check beforehand all the charges and fees while applying for the loan.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a></a>What to look out for?</strong></p>
<p>It is not always necessary to go with the bank your vehicle dealer suggests, you can always go to another lender if they offer better loan terms. Therefore, always do a thorough research by comparing lenders and their rates before finalizing a lender.</p>
