<p>No matter what type of loan it is, taking on new debt can be overwhelming. There are many factors to consider before signing your name on that dotted line. Overlooking certain details can cost you more money in the long run.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit scores:</strong>Before applying for any type of loan, it&rsquo;s important tocheck your credit scoresand reports first. Your credit scores &mdash; the most common of which are FICO Score and VantageScore &mdash; will set the tone for what lenders you may qualify with and what APRs you may receive.</li>
<li><strong>Loan purpose:</strong>If you choose to take out a loan that offers a flexible loan purpose, you&rsquo;ll still need to disclose to your lender how you plan to use the funds as some lenders have limitations on how loans can be used. Loans with specific purposes, like mortgages and auto loans, may require that you present the asset you plan to purchase with the money.</li>
<li><strong>APRs:</strong>This is how much it will cost you to take out a loan, including interest rates and fees. Agood credit scoreand a strong credit profile can help you access lower APRs which, in turn, allows you to spend less money on the loan.</li>
<li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong>How much time you have to repay your loan has an impact on what APRs you&rsquo;re paying. Typically, the longer your loan term is, the higher your APRs may be but the lower your monthly payments are. On the flip side, short repayment terms often come with lower APRs but higher monthly payments. However, other factors such as your credit score will also affect your APR and monthly payments.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong>How much you&rsquo;re allowed to borrow will depend on factors like your income, how you plan to use the loan and your credit history. Keep in mind, if you havebad credit, you may have a hard time getting a large loan amount.</li>
<li><strong>Secured versus unsecured loans:</strong>This is an important distinction to keep in mind &mdash; it can impact your APR, as well as the outcome of defaulting on a loan. When consideringsecured versus unsecured loans, the former tend to have lower APRs because they&rsquo;re less risky for lenders due to collateral. However, if you default on a secured personal loan, your lender can seize your collateral, which your lender can&rsquo;t do with an unsecured personal loan.</li>
