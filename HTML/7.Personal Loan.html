<p>A personal loanis money borrowed from a lender that can be used for nearly any purpose. Common reasons include paying off debt, financing a large purchase such as a vehicle or a boat, or covering the cost of a major expense like a wedding or a home renovation.</p>
<p>You canget a personal loanfrom online lenders, banks and credit unions, and the funds are provided in a lump sum. Once you receive the cash, you must make recurring, monthly payments until the debt has been fully repaid.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a personal loan is that they often charge lower fixed interest rates when compared to other forms of lending, like credit cards.</p>
<h2>How a personal loan works</h2>
<p>A personal loan is money you borrow from a bank or other financial institution with a set repayment period and consistent monthly payments. Most personal loans areunsecured, so you won&rsquo;t have to put down collateral to borrow the money.</p>
<p>Loan amounts vary widely, typically from around $1,000 to $50,000 or more, and interest rates currently range fromabout 6 percent to 36 percent. Repayment terms typically range from one to seven years.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get a personal loan, you&rsquo;ll have to complete an application and wait for approval &mdash; a process that may take anywhere from a few hours to several days. Once you&rsquo;re approved, the lender will disburse money into your bank account. You will also start to repay the money. Throughout the loan term, your lender will likely report your account activity to the credit bureaus, so making on-time payments is crucial to building apositive credit history.</p>
<p>When looking for a personal loan, you&rsquo;ll come across the following terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest rate:</strong>Personal loans charge borrowers a fixedAPR, or annual percentage rate, on top of the principal loan amount. This APR can vary depending on creditworthiness, income and other factors. The personal loan interest rate determines how much interest borrowers pay over the life of the loan.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly payment:</strong>Personal loans come with a fixed monthly payment that you&rsquo;ll make over the life of the loan,calculatedby adding up the principal and the interest. You can typically secure a lower monthly payment if you agree to pay off your loan over a longer stretch of time, although you will end up paying more in interest accrual than if you had a shorter repayment period.</li>
<li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong>Repayment timelines vary for personal loans, but consumers are often able to choose repayment terms between one and seven years. However, some lenders may offer terms of up to 12 years on larger personal loans.</li>
<li><strong>Origination fee:</strong>Some personal loans chargean initial origination feeon top of the original amount of your loan. While origination fees vary, it&rsquo;s common to see origination fees as high as 10 percent of your loan amount.</li>

<h2>How rates are determined</h2>
<p>Personal loans may come with a fixed rate, in which the APR stays the same over the life of the loan, or a variable rate, which can fluctuate over time. The APR includes the personal loan&rsquo;s interest rate in addition to the lender&rsquo;s fees for servicing the loan.</p>
<p>Lenders sometimes base variable rates on a well-known&nbsp;index rate, such as the prime rate. The prime rate is the interest rate at which banks and other financial institutions lend to one another.</p>
<p>Variable interest rates can be capped so they won&rsquo;t rise above a certain amount &mdash; even if the index rate increases. However, most personal loans come with fixed APRs, which means that your monthly payments will stay the same.</p>
<p>Your APR is determined based on several factors, the most important being your credit score. If you have a&nbsp;good credit score, you may qualify for a lender&rsquo;s lowest rates &mdash; the best rates typically go to people with credit scores above 700. Some of the additional factors that may impact the APR you&rsquo;re offered include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income:</strong>&nbsp;Lenders like to see a steady and reliable income source that can be used to make monthly payments.</li>
<li><strong>Payment history:</strong>&nbsp;Those with a solid history of making on-time payments typically qualify for lower rates.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong>&nbsp;Your&nbsp;debt-to-income ratio&nbsp;is the amount of your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. This number is an important part of your financial profile and overall attractiveness to a lender, as it helps gauge your ability to make loan payments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of personal loans</h2>
<p>While most personal loans work similarly, there are differences among loan products and lenders. Here are the main types of personal loans to know.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsecured personal loans:</strong>&nbsp;Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to put down any collateral to get the loan. With an unsecured personal loan, you&rsquo;ll receive a lump sum of cash, then repay your loan with fixed monthly payments over a repayment timeline.</li>
<li><strong>Secured personal loans:</strong>&nbsp;Secured personal loans&nbsp;require you to put down collateral to qualify. Instead of putting down cash as collateral, you may be able to use other assets, such as a home, boat or car. The lender may be able to seize those assets if you fall behind on payments.</li>
<li><strong>Credit-builder loans:</strong>&nbsp;Credit-builder loans&nbsp;don&rsquo;t extend you a line of credit. Instead, they are deposited into a savings account, and you make payments on your balance for the duration of the loan. Lenders report your payments to the credit bureaus, and at the end of the loan, you receive your payment in full, minus loan fees.</li>
<li><strong>Specialized lenders:</strong>&nbsp;Some service-oriented companies offer personal loans to their customers as a means of helping them afford their products or services. You might, for example, be offered financing by a home improvement store when you buy an appliance. These loans are typically convenient but don&rsquo;t always offer the best rates and terms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common uses of personal loans</h2>
<p>One big benefit of personal loans is that you can use your loan proceeds for almost any legal purpose, depending on the lender. This makes personal loans incredibly diverse and flexible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using a personal loan is only a good idea when it is consistent with being able to achieve other financial goals,&rdquo; says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate senior economic analyst and Washington bureau chief. &ldquo;If one has a significant amount of credit card debt, then I&rsquo;d say using a personal loan is probably significantly less than optimal,&rdquo; he adds, noting that the decision to get a personal loan is ultimately dependent on one&rsquo;s own financial situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some of the most common applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debt consolidation</h3>
<p>Debt consolidation loans&nbsp;are a type of personal loan for consumers who need to consolidate high-interest credit card debt or debt from other loans. These loans tend to come with lower interest rates that can help consumers save money on interest or secure a lower monthly payment.</p>
<h3>Financing big events</h3>
<p>Consumers with a pricey event like a&nbsp;wedding, a honeymoon or a vacation often take out personal loans to fill the gaps in their budget. Once the event is over, they get the benefit of repaying their loan with fixed monthly payments and a fixed interest rate over time.</p>
<p>While this may be a common reason, Hamrick advises against funding your honeymoon or dream wedding with a personal loan, citing that discretionary events are among the worst uses for a personal loan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re (the borrowers) really opting to provide their combined personal finances a setback even before they are married,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Creating unnecessary financial stress for a young marriage is a decision to be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Investing in yourself</h3>
<p>Personal loans can be used for some educational purchases, such as pursuing a workplace certification or attending a career-boosting seminar. However, many lenders prohibit the use of personal loans to cover college tuition fees.</p>
<p>You can also get a personal loan to pay for procedures that improve your self-image, such as&nbsp;dental implants&nbsp;or cosmetic surgery. Hamrick encourages borrowers to look at what&rsquo;s medically necessary versus what isn&rsquo;t before taking out a loan for procedures, especially after looking at the loan&rsquo;s rate and terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a discretionary purchase in this category, one key question is how the loan would affect their broad financial goals and capabilities,&rdquo; he says, adding that if the procedure is a medical necessity, then a loan may be one of the &lsquo;least worst&rsquo; options.</p>
