<h2>What Is an Instant Personal Loan?</h2>
<p>An &ldquo;instant&rdquo; personal loan is apersonal loanin which the lender immediately makes a decision on whether to approve the loan. Theselendersaim to assess your application and send you your funds quickly.</p>
<div></div>
<p>An instant personal loan works in the same way as a standard personal loan. You can apply online for this type of loan, and your lender will perform acredit checkto determine if you qualify for the loan and whatinterest ratethey can offer you.</p>
<div></div>
<p>If you are approved for the loan and accept it, the lender will send you alump sumof money. You must then pay this money back, generally in equal monthly installments over a set period, which is typically a few months to several years. You&rsquo;ll payintereston the loan, and sometimes fees.</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>

<h2>How Fast Can You Get and Use a Personal Loan?</h2>
<p>Some lenders offer fast processing times for personal loans. Among these lenders are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rocket Loans</strong>: With Rocket Loans, you can get up to $45,000 as soon as the same day you apply.1</li>
<li><strong>LightStream</strong>: LightStream&rsquo;s loans can be disbursed as soon as the same day you apply. Same-day funding is available if your application is approved, you sign the loan agreement, and you complete the verification process by 2:30 p.m. Eastern time and schedule funding by 3 p.m.2</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>However, while lenders may be able to process your loan application the same day you apply, two factors may slow down a personal loan application:</p>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding a loan</strong>: Taking time to research lenders, interest rates, and theterms of your loanmay save you a significant amount of money in the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer times</strong>: Lenders will often send your money viaAutomated Clearing House (ACH) transfer. While this is potentiallyquicker than a wire transfer, it&rsquo;s not instant. You&rsquo;ll have to wait for your bank to accept the transfer and give you access to the funds, which can take a few days.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>So, even if you are approved for a loan on the same day you apply, the process to receiving the money normally takes at least a few days.</p>
