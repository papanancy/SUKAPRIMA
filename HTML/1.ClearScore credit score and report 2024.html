<h3>What is ClearScore?</h3>
<p>ClearScore is a credit reference agency that offers credit reports and credit scores based on Equifax data. Unlike the major credit agencies, ClearScore offers these services on a free, lifelong basis.</p>
<p>The tradeoff for free credit report access is that ClearScore will recommend other financial products to you based on your credit profile, from which it receives a commission.</p>
<h3>Is ClearScore safe?</h3>
<p>Yes, ClearScore is a recognised credit reference agency registered in the UK. It is also authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
<p>ClearScore also uses 256-bit encryption to protect its customers&rsquo; personal information and holds all data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<h3>Is ClearScore any good?</h3>
<p>ClearScore&rsquo;s biggest selling point is the fact that it offers its credit report services for free. Whereas the other major credit reference agencies generally only let you access your credit report for free on a limited-time basis, ClearScore offers ongoing access to your credit score and credit report.</p>
<h3>How does ClearScore make money?</h3>
<p>Unlike other credit rating agencies, ClearScore doesn&rsquo;t make money from charging for its credit report services. It instead receives commissions on financial products (such as loans and credit cards) that are offered by other lenders and suggested to you through ClearScore based on your credit score and history.</p>
<p>However, ClearScore will only recommend financial products and services that you&rsquo;re likely to be eligible for given your current credit profile.</p>
<h3>What is a good credit score for ClearScore?</h3>
<p>ClearScore uses Equifax data to calculate your credit score, which is then rated using the following scale:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Credit score</th>
<th>Rating</th>
</tr>

<tbody>

<th><strong>0&ndash;438</strong></th>

<div>We show offers we can track - that's not every product on the market...yet. Unless we've said otherwise, products are in no particular order. The terms "best", "top", "cheap" (and variations of these) aren't ratings, though we always explain what's great about a product when we highlight it. This is subject to ourterms of use. When you make major financial decisions, consider getting independent financial advice. Always consider your own circumstances when you compare products so you get what's right for you</div>
