<h1>What Is Debt Consolidation and When Is It a Good Idea?</h1>
<h1>Debt consolidation refers to taking out a new loan or credit card to pay off other existing loans or credit cards. By combining multiple debts into a single, larger loan, you may also be able to obtain more favorable payoff terms, such as a lower interest rate, lower monthly payments, or both. Here's how to decide whether you should consolidate your debts and how to go about it if you do.</h1>
<h2>How Debt Consolidation Works</h2>
<p>You can roll old debt into new debt in several different ways, such as by taking out a new personal loan, a new credit card with a high enoughcredit limit, or a home equity loan. Then, you pay off your smaller loans with the new one. If you are using a new credit card to consolidate other credit card debt, for example, you can transfer the balances on your old cards to your new one. Somebalance transfer credit cardseven offer incentives, such as a 0% interest rate on your balance for a period of time.1</p>
<div></div>
<p>In addition to the possibility of lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments, debt consolidation can be a way to simplify your financial life, with fewer bills to pay each month and fewer due dates to worry about.</p>
<h2>An Example of Debt Consolidation</h2>
<p>Suppose you have three credit cards and owe a total of $20,000 on them, with a 22.99% average annual interest rate. You would need to pay about $1,048 a month for 24 months to bring the balances down to zero, and you'd pay about $4,601 in interest during that time.</p>
<div></div>
<p>If you consolidated those credit cards into a lower-interest card or loan at an 11% annual rate, you would need to pay about $933 a month for the same 24 months to erase the debt, and your interest charges would total about $2,157.</p>
<p>With a 0% credit card, your payments would be even lower, at least while the promotional period was in effect.</p>

<h2>Risks of Debt Consolidation</h2>
<p>Debt consolidation also has somedownsidesto consider. For one, when you take out a new loan, yourcredit score could suffer a minor hit, which could affect whether you qualify for other new loans.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Depending on how you consolidate your loans, you could also risk paying more in total interest. For example, if you take out a new loan with lower monthly payments but a longer repayment term, you may end up paying more in total interest over time.</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>You can also hire a debt consolidation company to assist you. However, they often charge hefty initial and monthly fees. It's usually easier and cheaper to consolidate debt on your own with a personal loan from a bankor a low-interest credit card.</p>

<h2>Types of Debt Consolidation Loans</h2>
<p>You can consolidate debt by using different types of loans or credit cards. Which will be best for you will depend on the terms and types of your current loans as well as your current financial situation.</p>
<div></div>
<p>There are two broad types ofdebt consolidation loans:secured and unsecured loans. Secured loans arebacked by an asset like your home, which serves as collateral for the loan.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Unsecured loans, on the other hand, are not backed by assets and can be more difficult to get. They also tend to have higher interest rates and lower qualifying amounts. With either type of loan, interest rates are still typically lowerthan the rates charged on credit cards. And in most cases, the rates arefixed, so they won't rise over the repayment period.</p>
<div></div>
<p>With any type of loan, you'll want to prioritize which of your debts to pay off first. It often makes sense to start with the highest-interest debt and work your way down the list.</p>
